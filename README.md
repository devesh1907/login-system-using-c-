FEATURE-STRUCTURE , STRING  AND FILE HANDLING
DESCRIPTION-1). STRUCTURE -It is user defined datatype in c language which allows
 us to combine data of different types together.
 2). STRING- A string is a sequence of characters terminated with a null
 Character i.e ,\0
 3). FILE HANDLING-It is refer to task of storing data in form of input or
 Output produced by running c programs in data files
STEP OF PROGRAM-
 1). ALL THE REQUIRED HEADER FILES ARE WRITTEN.
 2). HERE I HAVE USED MACROS TO DEFINE THE KEY
 AND THEIR ASCII VALUE FOR THE SELECTION OF
 FEATURE WE WANT TO USE.
 3). THEN I MADE 2 FUNCTIONS SIGN UP AND LOGIN.
 4). DEFINED A STRUCTURE IN WHICH CONTAINS
 2 CHAR ARRAY FOR USERNAME AND PASSWORD.
 5). ACCESS THE FILE POINTER P IS DEFINED
 6). A WHILE LOOP IS MADE WHICH WILL RUN INFINITE
 UNTIL THE MACROS ESCAPE KEYWORD IS USED TO
 BREAK.
 7). NOW I HAVED USED GOTO FUNCTION I.e, gotoxy
 IT IS USED FOR CO ORDINATE TO SEND THE CURSOR
 AT A SPECIFIC LOCATION FOR BETTER PRSENTATION
 OF OUTOUT AND EASIER INTERFACE.
 8). NOW I HAVE SWITCH CASE FOR ORDER OF FUNCTION AND
 GETCH FOR HOLDING THE FUNCTION AND DATA
 9). IN CASE 1-ASCII CODE 59 IS USED WHICH FOR F1
 DEFINED FOR LOGIN AND A LOOP FOR PRINTING A
 LINE TO GIVE A LOOK FOR LOADING ANIMATION.
 AND BREAK IS USED FOR THIS CASE
 10). SIMILARLY, F2 IS DEFINED FOR SIGNUP.HERE DELAY
 FUNCTION IS USED FOR LOADING AND DEALYING
 THE PROGRAM FOR PARTICULAR TIME.
 11). SIGNUP FUNCTION-FOPEN IS USED AND
 2 PARAMETERS IS DEFINED .BIN FOR ADDRESS
 AND AB MODE FOR FILE.
 AB-APPENDING BINARY IS USED SO THAT THE
 OLD DATA DOES NOT GET OVERRIDE BY NEW DATA.
 12). PASSWORD-FOR LOOP IS USED WHICH WILL WORK
 UNTIL ENTER IS NOT PRESSED WHICH IS DEFINED USING
 ASCII VALUE 13. S.PASSWORD IS USED FOR STORING OF
 TEMPORARY C VALUE WHICH GET VALUE WITH GETCH
 13). IF USER PRESS ENTER THE DATA WILL BE WRITTEN IN
 BINARY DATA BY FWRITE.
 14).LOGIN FUNCTION-THE REQUIRED VARAIBALE IS DEFINED
 CHKP AND CHKU ARE USED FOR CHECKING PASSWORD
 RESPECTIVELY.FOR THE FILE IS OPENED IN RB MODE TO
 READ IN BINARY
 15). FOR LOOP TO PRINT * IS USED FOR HIDING THE PASSWORD
 16). EOF CONDITION IS DEFINED FOR CLOSING THE FILE.
 17). FREAD FOR READING THE BINARY FILE.
 18). STRING-THE COMMAND STRCMP IS USED FOR CHECKING
 THE CHKP AND CHKU AND CONDITION IS DEFINED RESPECTIVELY
